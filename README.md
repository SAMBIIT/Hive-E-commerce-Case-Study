# Hive-E-commerce-Case-Study

### Problem Statement-
With online sales gaining popularity, tech companies are exploring ways to improve their sales by analysing customer behaviour and gaining insights about product trends. Furthermore, the websites make it easier for customers to find the products they require without much scavenging. So, as a big data analyst, our job is to extract data and gather insights from a real-life data set of an e-commerce company.

Our Analysis will answer the following questions-
- What is the total revenue generated due to purchases made in October?
- What is the total sum of purchases per month in a single output?
- Write a query to find the change in revenue generated due to purchases from October to November?
- Find distinct categories of products. Categories with null category code can be ignored.
- Find the total number of products available under each category.
- Which brand had the maximum sales in October and November combined?
- Which brands increased their sales from October to November?
- Your company wants to reward the top 10 users of its website with a Golden Customer plan. Write a query to generate a list of top 10 users who spend the most.
